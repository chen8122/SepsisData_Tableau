# SepsisProject
## Overview  
The Sepsis project involved the analysis of a vast dataset comprising over 1.5 million data points from more than 40,000 ICU patients. This dataset included hourly records, demographic information, and the presence of a sepsis label indicating the hour of sepsis diagnosis. Additionally, the project included the bloodwork test results of 34 key biomarkers associated with sepsis.  
The main objectives of the project were as follows:  
- Demographic and ICU Stay Information: Analyze the demographic information and ICU stay details of the patients to identify potential patterns and calculate key performance indicators(KPIs).  
- Biomarker Correlation Analysis: Establishing correlations among the biomarkers, with a specific focus on Hematocrit (Hct), Platelets, and White Blood Cell (WBC) counts, to gain insights into their relationship with sepsis.

Analysis of Specific Organ Pathologies: Analyzing specific organ pathologies related to sepsis by combining key biomarkers and using specific criteria. Particularly, using the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) criteria to perform lung analysis.

SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome) Task: Leading the identification of early signs of sepsis by determining SIRS criteria. Developing a conditional formatting spreadsheet with email alert functionality to notify responsible hospital staff of patients meeting the pre-alert criteria, ensuring prompt attention.

Apache II Score Analysis: Utilizing the Apache II scoring system to assess the severity of illness and predict patient outcomes.

Hyperglycemia Patient Analysis: Investigating the relationship between hyperglycemia (high blood sugar levels) and sepsis among the patients in the dataset.

Identification of Organ Failure: Determining the primary reason for patient admission by identifying which organ failure(s) contributed to their condition.

Septic Shock Analysis: Analyzing cases of septic shock within the dataset, focusing on understanding its occurrence, characteristics, and associated factors.

By conducting these analyses, the project aimed to enhance the understanding of sepsis, identify key factors related to its development and progression, and provide insights that can potentially aid in early detection and treatment.
